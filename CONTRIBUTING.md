## üìè Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React
- Use **ES6+** modern JavaScript features
- Follow **React Hooks** patterns (no class components)
- Use **Styled Components** for styling
- Prefer **functional components**
- Use **async/await** over Promise chains

### Code Formatting
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings
- **Semicolons**: Required
- **Line Length**: 100 characters max
- **Trailing Commas**: Required in objects/arrays

### Example Code Style
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledComponent = styled.div`
  background: var(--bg-primary);
  color: var(--text-primary);
  padding: 16px;
`;

const MyComponent = ({ connection, onConnect }) => {
  const [isConnecting, setIsConnecting] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic here
  }, [connection]);

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    setIsConnecting(true);
    try {
      await onConnect(connection);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Connection failed:', error);
    } finally {
      setIsConnecting(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <StyledComponent>
      <button onClick={handleConnect} disabled={isConnecting}>
        {isConnecting ? 'Connecting...' : 'Connect'}
      </button>
    </StyledComponent>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### CSS/Styling
- Use **CSS Custom Properties** for theming
- Follow **BEM-like** naming for CSS classes
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- Use **rem/em** units over px when appropriate

### File Organization
- One React component per file
- Use **PascalCase** for component filenames
- Use **camelCase** for utility functions
- Group related files in appropriate directories

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test on multiple Linux distributions
- Verify SSH connections work with different servers
- Test SFTP operations (upload, download, delete)
- Verify UI responsiveness and accessibility

### Automated Testing (Future)
We're planning to add:
- Unit tests with Jest
- Integration tests for SSH operations
- End-to-end tests with Playwright
- Performance testing for large file operations

### Testing Checklist
Before submitting a PR, ensure:
- [ ] New features work as expected
- [ ] Existing features still work
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] UI is responsive across different screen sizes
- [ ] SSH connections work with password and key auth
- [ ] SFTP operations function correctly
- [ ] Application builds without errors
- [ ] No memory leaks in long-running sessions

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Use **JSDoc** comments for functions and classes
- Include parameter and return type information
- Document complex algorithms and business logic

```javascript
/**
 * Establishes an SSH connection to a remote server
 * @param {Object} connection - Connection configuration
 * @param {string} connection.hostname - Server hostname or IP
 * @param {number} connection.port - SSH port (default: 22)
 * @param {string} connection.username - SSH username
 * @param {string} [connection.password] - SSH password
 * @param {string} [connection.privateKey] - SSH private key path
 * @returns {Promise<SSHSession>} Connected SSH session
 * @throws {Error} If connection fails
 */
const connectSSH = async (connection) => {
  // Implementation here
};
```
